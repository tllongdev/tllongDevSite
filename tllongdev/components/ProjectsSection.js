This app aims at making that person's job as efficient as possible! After requesting access to APIs of major shopping chains with no luck, I chose Home Depot because all of the data I needed for a proof-of-concept is available via their mobile website. Given an online cart with items available at a chosen store location, MERTH deploys a headless Chrome web browser to scrape the data, then applies a Traveling Salesman heuristic, finally returns an svg store map with the most efficient route to obtain all items.",
