The name of the object is then translated to a foreign language of the user's choice in real-time via a Google Cloud Services API. The user can actively switch languages while using the app. The native language is set to the user's mobile device preference. \n\nThis application was created as my 'Hackathon' project at Fullstack Academy. It won the 'Nerd Cred' award for most technically challenging project.",

			"M.E.R.T.H. === Most Efficient Route Through HomeDepot... lol what?! Please, hear me out..:) Many stores now offer same day in-store pickup; meaning a store employee will go get the items for you. This app aims at making that person's job as efficient as possible! After requesting access to APIs of major shopping chains with no luck, I chose Home Depot because all of the data I needed for a proof-of-concept is available via their mobile website. Given an online cart with items available at a chosen store location, MERTH deploys a headless Chrome web browser to scrape the data, then applies a Traveling Salesman heuristic, finally returns an svg store map with the most efficient route to obtain all items.",
